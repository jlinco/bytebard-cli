# bytebard-cli

## Introduction
The purpose of this tool is to provide a means to quickly scaffold web and mobile projects based on my favorite tools and libraries. This project is heavily inspired by the T3 stack and Shadcn/UI. Currently the only thing that works is the webApp scaffolding based on React, Tanstack Query, Tanstack Router and Vite.



## TODO
 - Add configuration support for tailwind (theming, components, etc  - RE: shadcn/ui)
 - Add support for Mobile Apps using React Native
 - Add support for cross-platform apps based on Expo and React Native
